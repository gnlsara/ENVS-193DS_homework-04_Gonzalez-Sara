# Set-up

```{r libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(lterdatasampler)
library(naniar)
```

```{r read-in-data}
fishes <- read_csv(here("data", "ntl6_v12.csv"))
```

```{r filtering-data}
perch_data <- fishes %>%
  filter(spname=="YELLOWPERCH") %>% 
  subset(select = c(year4, spname, length, weight))
```

# Problem 1

## Hypotheses

1.  Mathematical Hypotheses

    1.  Null: The predictor variable does not predict the response variable.
    2.  Alternative: The predictor variable does predict the response variable.

    Biological Hypotheses

    1.  Null: Fish length does not significantly predict fish weight for trout perch.
    2.  Alternative: Fish length significantly predicts fish weight for trout perch.

## Missing Data

2.  

```{r}

```
